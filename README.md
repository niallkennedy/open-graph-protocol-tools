[Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/ "Open Graph protocol community site") enhances information associated with a webpage through key-value pairs included as `<meta>` elements in your HTML.

This project includes tools to validate and sanitize inputs before generating Open Graph protocol markup on your webpages. This project standardizes outputs for easy indexing by consuming agents.

## Consuming agents

### Facebook

[Facebook indexes Open Graph protocol markup](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/opengraph/ "Facebook Open Graph protocol") found on pages shared in a member's social news feed. This markup also enhances social news feed stories generated by the [Like button social plugin](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/like "Facebook Like button") and [Facebook Share](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/share).

Open Graph protocol markup turns webpages into objects within the Facebook social graph, increasing search exposure and uniquely classifying your site and story type within the social news feed.

The [Facebook Object Debugger](http://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug) displays a Facebook interpretation of your site's Open Graph protocol content.

### mixi Check
